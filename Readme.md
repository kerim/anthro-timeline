# Tags and other metadata for CAT Timeline
Alex Golub, UH Mānoa

This is a timeline of the history of sociocultural anthropology in the USA, the UK, and France from 1927 to the present. It is designed to be viewed in Aeon Timeline.

The timeline has two arcs: publications (books, articles, etc.) and institutions (everything that isn't a publication). The entities in the timeline are individual anthropologists. All events in the timeline should have a citation in the 'notes' field of the timeline.

## Colors
All events are color-coded based on where they happened (for publications, this is the main office of the publishing house). A list of colors can be found below.

- red - America, Canada
- blue - France
- yellow - UK, Australia, New Zealand
- purple - Europe (including Russia/former USSR)
- Orange - Africa
- Green - latin America
- light green - Asia (yes, I know this is a bit broad!)

## Tags
Tags are associated with each event. A list of tags can be found below. Importantly, I've attempted to tag all events that happened at institutions. Unless otherwise specified, all events at institutions occurred in the anthropology department of that institution. When they did not, a tag is added to specify what department they took place in.

Births, deaths, and Ph.D.s are not tagged since they are named in events and can just be searched for by name in the title.
